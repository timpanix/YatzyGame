Goal of the game
==================
The goal of Yatzy is to obtain the highest score from rolling 5 dice.
The game consists of 13 rounds. In each round, you roll the dice and then score the roll in one of 13 fields.
You must score once in each category.
The score is determined by a different rule for each field.
The game ends when all 13 fields have been scored.

Rolling the dice
================
You are  allowed to roll the dice a maximum of three times.
After rolling the dice, you can either score the current roll or re-roll any or all of the dice. 
After the third roll, you must chose a field to score.

Scoring
=======
To score your combination of 5 dice, you select one of the displayed valid options.
Once a field has been scored, it cannot be scored again for the rest of the game.

Upper Section Scoring
=====================
If you score in the upper section of the table, your score is the total of the specified dice face.

Example: You score 5 - 2 - 5 - 6 - 5.
 - In the "Fives" field, your score would be 15 (3 x 5);
 - In the "Twos" field, your score would be 2 (1 x 2);
 - In the "Sixes" field, your score would be 6 (1 x 6);
 - In the "Aces, "Threes" and "Fours" fields, your score would be 0.

If the sum of all upper scores is 63 or more, you win a bonus of 35 points.
(Please note that 63 is the total of three each of 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s and 6s).

Lower Section Scoring
=====================
In the lower scores, you score either a set amount, or zero if you don't satisfy the category requirements.

3 and 4 of a kind
------------------
You score the total of ALL the dice.

Small and Large Straight
------------------------
A Straight is a sequence of consecutive dice faces. 
A small straight is 4 consecutive faces (30 points), and a large straight 5 consecutive faces (40 points).

Full House
----------
A Full House is where you have 3 of a kind and 2 of a kind (25 points).

Yatzy
-----
A Yatzy is 5 of a kind (= all dice show identical face).
The first Yatzy scores 50 points, although you may decide NOT to score it as Yatzy, 
instead choosing to take it as an upper section score and safeguard you bonus.

Additional Yatzy
-----------------
If you roll a second (third, fourth etc.) Yatzy in a game and you scored your first Yatzy in the Yatzy field,
you win an "Additional Yatzy Bonus" of 100 Points. However, in order to get the bonus, 
you MUST also put this roll into another field as follows:
- If the corresponding Upper section field is NOT filled, then you must score there.
  (Eg. if you rolled 4 - 4 - 4 - 4 - 4 and the "Fours" field is not filled, you must put the score there).
- If the corresponding Upper section category is filled, you are allowed to score an additional Yatzy
  in ANY lower section field (the usual points apply in addition to the bonus). 
- If all fields of the lower sections are filled already, you need to score 0 in a remaining field of the upper section.

Chance
------
This is like the joker field. You can roll anything and be able to put it in the Chance category. 
You score the total of the dice faces.


What to do if no option available?
==================================
If you have a poor score that you can't use for any field (probably towards the end of the game 
when most fields are filled), you must cross out one of the remaining fields (the field score is set to 0).
